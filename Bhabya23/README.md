## Problem Statement

The problem is based on the widespread water shortages in the country. 

## Proposed Solution

free2O is an organisation that aims at providing low-cost water harvesting equipment and services to meet the daily water requirements.
Those in dire need of water can obtain cost-free supply from those harvests.
There are primarily two aspects of the project:

* Once a person applies for one of our low-cost water-harvesting projects,
  we will see to it that the project is begun as soon as possible. The cost for the equipments
  and the for transportation and setup services is covered in the fee. He is then considered a 'Harvester'

* Any members, who are in dire need of water, can apply for the free water supply here. If they are found to be within an area where
  a Harvester is present. Then the Harvester can provide the cost-free water to the appliers (within a certain max limit).

Additionally, the organisation also aims in bring about public awareness about water conservation by teaching them 
the applicaitons of various water conservation and harvesting techniques.
