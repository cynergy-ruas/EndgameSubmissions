-Problem Statment:
  Way to chat with a bunch of friends.
__________________ For example, while watching a movie maybe the endgame.
-Proposed Solution: Free chat rooms provide means to chat with friends and families privately.
__________________ What makes these chat sites different from other chat rooms is that they're meant specifically for on-demand, one-on-one or group chatting between people you know.
__________________ When both of you set up an account, you can chat privately with just each other, often from your computer, phone, or ?tablet.
